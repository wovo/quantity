# Quantity

This is work in progress, not fit for use (yet)

### Summary

Quantity is a small library for creating a numeric type that express
a quantity of something. 
Quantities of the same thing can be added and subtracted, 
and multiplied and divided by plain values.
Quantities of different things can't be added or subtracted.
Quantities can be multiplied, but this sort-of multiplies what
they are quantities of, just like physical units.
