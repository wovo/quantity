plain int, float etc. are (often) CODE SMELLS

- named values, in order of preference
   magic numbers
   variables
   #define
   consts
   enum
   enum class

- loop indices
   use range-based for loops
   
- loop a fixed number of times
   consider using a loop<> that hides the type and name of the loop varible
   and it can handle unrolling
   
- specify size and signedness
   int / unit
   fast
   least
   8 / 16 / 32 / 64   
   
- use std::byte for untyped memory
   
- subranges
   if it can only be a limited range of values, express so
   compiler can find the correct size
   even if you don't want it at run-time
   but do test *twice*
   
- ratio   
   
- scale theory
   nominal
   ordinal
   interval
   ratio
   
- quantity / unit

- torsor
